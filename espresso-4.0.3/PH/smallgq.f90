subroutine smallgq (xq, at, bg, s, nsym, irgq, nsymq, irotmq, &
     minus_q, gi, gimq)
  !-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  !
  ! This routine selects, among the symmetry matrices of the point group
  ! of a crystal, the symmetry operations which leave q unchanged.
  ! Furthermore it checks if one of the matrices send q <-> -q+G. In
  ! this case minus_q is set true.
  !
  ! Revised   2 Sept. 1995 by Andrea Dal Corso
  ! Modified 22 April 1997 by SdG: minus_q is sought also among sym.op.
  !                such that Sq=q+G (i.e. the case q=-q+G is dealt with).
