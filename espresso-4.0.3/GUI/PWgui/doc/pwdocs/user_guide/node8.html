[edit] Configure</A>
</H2>

<P>
To configure the Quantum-ESPRESSO source package, run the configure script. It will (try to) detect compilers and libraries available on your machine, and set up things accordingly. Presently it is expected to work on most Linux 32- and 64-bit PCs (all Intel and AMD CPUs), PC clusters, IBM SP
machines, SGI Origin and Altix, some HP-Compaq Alpha machines, NEC SX, Cray X1, Mac
OS X, MS-Windows PCs. It may work with some assistance also on other architectures (see below).

<P>
For cross-compilation, you have to specify the target machine with the - 
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>-host option (see below). This feature has not been extensively tested, but we had at least one successful report (compilation for NEC SX6 on a PC).

<P>
Specifically, configure generates the following files:

<P>
<PRE>   make.sys:           compilation rules and ﬂags
   configure.msg:      a report of the configuration run
   include/fft_defs.h: defines the type of fortran variable containing a C pointer
   include/c_defs.h:   defines C to fortran calling convention and a few more things
                       (used by C files)
</PRE>

<P>
configure.msg is only used by configure to print its final report. It isn’t
needed for compilation. NOTA BENE: unlike previous versions, configure
no longer runs the makedeps.sh shell script that updates dependencies. If
you modify the program sources, run makedeps.sh or type make depend to
update files make.depend in the various subdirectories.

<P>
You should always be able to compile the Quantum-ESPRESSO suite
of programs without having to edit any of the generated files. However you
may have to tune configure by specifying appropriate environment variables
and/or command-line options. Usually the most tricky part is to get external
libraries recognized and used: see the  Libraries
section for details and hints.

<P>
Environment variables may be set in any of these ways:

<P>
<PRE>    export VARIABLE=value               # sh, bash, ksh
    ./configure
    setenv VARIABLE value               # csh, tcsh
    ./configure
    ./configure VARIABLE=value          # any shell
</PRE>

<P>
Some environment variables that are relevant to configure are:

<P>
<PRE>    ARCH:         label identifying the machine type (see below)
    F90, F77, CC: names of Fortran 95, Fortran 77, and C compilers
    MPIF90:       name of parallel Fortran 95 compiler (using MPI)
    CPP:          source file preprocessor (defaults to \$CC -E)
    LD:           linker (defaults to \$MPIF90)
    CFLAGS, FFLAGS, F90FLAGS, CPPFLAGS, LDFLAGS: compilation ﬂags
    LIBDIRS:      extra directories to search for libraries (see below)
</PRE>

<P>
For example, the following command line:

<P>
<PRE>    ./configure MPIF90=mpf90 FFLAGS="-O2 -assume byterecl" $\backslash$
                 CC=gcc CFLAGS=-O3 LDFLAGS=-static
</PRE>

<P>
instructs configure to use mpf90 as Fortran 95 compiler with ﬂags -O2
-assume byterecl, gcc as C compiler with ﬂags -O3, and to link with ﬂags
-static. Note that the value of FFLAGS must be quoted, because it contains
spaces.

<P>
If your machine type is unknown to configure, you may use the ARCH
variable to suggest an architecture among supported ones. Try the one that
looks more similar to your machine type; you’ll probably have to do some
additional tweaking. Currently supported architectures are:

<P>
<PRE>     ia32:   Intel 32-bit machines (x86) running Linux
     ia64:   Intel 64-bit (Itanium) running Linux
     amd64:  AMD 64-bit (Opteron) running Linux
     aix:    IBM AIX machines
     mips:   SGI MIPS machines
     alpha:  HP-Compaq alpha machines
     alinux: HP-Compaq alpha running Linux
     sparc:  Sun SPARC machines
     solaris:PC's running SUN-Solaris
     crayx1: Cray X1 machines
     macppc: Apple PowerPC machines running Mac OS X
     mac686: Apple Intel machines running Mac OS X
     cygwin: MS-Windows PCs with Cygwin
     necsx:  NEC SX-6 and SX-8 machines
     ppc64:  Linux PowerPC machines, 64 bits
     ppc64-mn:as above, with IBM xlf compiler
</PRE>

<P>
Finally, configure recognizes the following command-line options:

<P>
<PRE>     -$\,$-disable-parallel: compile serial code, even if parallel environment is available
     -$\,$-disable-shared: don’t use shared libraries: generate static executables
     -$\,$-enable-shared: use shared libraries.
     -$\,$-host=target~: specify target machine for cross-compilation.
                     Target must be a string identifying the architecture that you want
                     to compile for; you can obtain it by running config.guess on
                     the target machine.
</PRE>

<P>
If you want to modify the configure script (advanced users only!), see the 
Developer Manual,  How to edit the configure script section. You will need GNU Autoconf (http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/)
installed.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00008100000000000000">
[edit] Libraries</A>
</H3>

<P>
Quantum-ESPRESSO makes use of the following external libraries:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>BLAS (http://www.netlib.org/blas/) and LAPACK (http://www.netlib.org/lapack/) for linear algebra
</LI>
<LI>FFTW (http://www.fftw.org/) for Fast Fourier Transforms
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
A copy of the needed routines is provided with the distribution. However,
when available, optimized vendor-specific libraries can be used instead: this
often yields huge performance gains.

<P>
<B>BLAS and LAPACK</B> Quantum-ESPRESSO can use the following architecture-
specific replacements for BLAS and LAPACK:

<P>
<PRE>     MKL for Intel Linux PCs
     ACML for AMD Linux PCs
     ESSL for IBM machines
     complib.sgimath for SGI Origin
     SCSL for SGI Altix
     SUNperf for Sun
     cxml for HP-Compaq Alphas.
</PRE>

<P>
If none of these is available, we suggest that you use the optimized ATLAS
library (http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/). Note that ATLAS is not
a complete replacement for LAPACK: it contains all of the BLAS, plus the
LU code, plus the full storage Cholesky code. Follow the instructions in the
ATLAS distributions to produce a full LAPACK replacement.

<P>
Sergei Lisenkov reported success and good performances with optimized
BLAS by Kazushige Goto. They can be freely downloaded  (but not redistributed):
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/flame/goto/

<P>
<B>FFT</B> Quantum-ESPRESSO can use the following vendor-specific FFT 
libraries:

<P>
<PRE>     IBM ESSL
     SGI SCSL
     SUN sunperf
     NEC ASL.
</PRE>

<P>
If you use FFTW, you have to choose before compilation whether to
load the built-in copy (v.2) of FFTW or a precompiled v.2 or v.3 FFTW
library. This is done using preprocessing options: -D__FFTW 
(for precompiled v.2), -D__FFTW -D__USE_INTERNAL_FFTW 
(for internal v.2), -D__FFTW3 (for precompiled v.3). 
Presently, configure only recognizes external FFTW v.2; if not found, 
it falls back to the internal copy. If you have recent
versions of MKL installed, you may use the 
FFTW interface provided with MKL, but you will have to compile it
and to modify the make.sys accordingly.

<P>
 
<BR>
If you want to link to a precompiled FFTW v.&lt;3 library, you will need
the corresponding fftw.h include file. That may or may not have been
installed on your system together with the library: in particular, most Linux
distributions split libraries into “base” and “development” packages, include
files normally belonging to the latter. Thus if you can’t find fftw.h on your
machine, chances are you must install the FFTW development package (how
to do this and what it is exactly called depends on your operating system
version).

<P>
If instead the file is there, but configure doesn’t find it, you may specify
its location in the INCLUDEFFTW environment variable. For example:

<P>
<PRE>  ./configure INCLUDEFFTW="/usr/lib/fftw-2.1.3/fftw"
</PRE>

<P>
If everything else fails, you’ll have to modify the make.sys file manually: see
the section on  manual configuration. 

<P>
<B>MPI libraries</B> For parallel execution, Quantum-ESPRESSO uses the MPI libraries.
In well-configured machine, configure should find the appropriate parallel compiler
for you, and this should find the appropriate libraries. Since often this doesn't 
happen, especially on PC clusters, see the section on 
 Linux PC clusters with MPI.

<P>
<B>Other libraries</B> Quantum-ESPRESSO can use the MASS vector math
library from IBM, if available (only on AIX).

<P>
The configure script attempts to find optimized libraries, but may fail
if they have been installed in non-standard places. You should examine
the final value of BLAS_LIBS, LAPACK_LIBS, FFT_LIBS, MPI_LIBS (if needed),
MASS_LIBS (IBM only), either in the output of configure or in the generated
make.sys, to check whether it found all the libraries that you intend to use.

<P>
If some library was not found, you can specify a list of directories to search
in the environment variable LIBDIRS, and rerun configure; directories in the
list must be separated by spaces. For example:

<P>
<PRE>  ./configure LIBDIRS="/opt/intel/mkl70/lib/32 /usr/lib/math"
</PRE>

<P>
If this still fails, you may set some or all of the *_LIBS variables manually
and retry. For example:

<P>
<PRE>  ./configure BLAS_LIBS="-L/usr/lib/math -lf77blas -latlas_sse"
</PRE>

<P>
Beware that in this case, configure will blindly accept the specified value,
and won’t do any extra search. This is so that if configure finds any library
that you don’t want to use, you can override it.

<P>
<B>Please note:</B> If you change any settings after a previous (successful or
failed) compilation, you must run "make clean" before recompiling, unless you
know exactly which routines are aﬀected by the changed settings and how to
force their recompilation.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00008200000000000000">
[edit] Manual configurations</A>
</H3>

<P>
If "configure" stops before the end, and you don't find a way to fix
it, you have to write working "make.sys", "include/fft_defs.h" and
"include/c_defs.h" files. 
For the latter two files, follow the explanations in 
"include/defs.h.README". 

<P>
If "configure" has run till the end, you should need only to
edit "make.sys". A few templates (each for a diﬀerent machine type)
are provided in the install/ directory: they have names of the
form Make.system, where "system" is a string identifying the 
architecture and compiler.

<P>
If you have the Intel compiler ifc v.6 or earlier, you will have to 
run the script ifcmods.sh.

<P>
Most likely (and even more so if there isn’t an exact match to your 
machine type), you’ll have to tweak make.sys by hand. In particular, 
you must
specify the full list of libraries that you intend to link to.

<P>
<B>NOTA BENE:</B> If you modify the program sources, run the script makedeps.sh
or type make depend to update files make.depend in the various subdirectories.

<P>
