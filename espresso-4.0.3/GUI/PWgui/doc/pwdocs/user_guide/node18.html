</H2>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION000018100000000000000">
[edit] Installation</A>
</H3>

<P>
Most installation problems have obvious origins and can be solved by reading
error messages and acting accordingly. Sometimes the reason for a failure
is less obvious. In such a case, you should look into the 
Installation#Installation_issues
section of the User Guide, and into the pw_forum archive to see if a similar
problem (with solution) is described. If you get really weird error messages
during installation, look for them with your preferred Internet search engine
(such as Google).

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION000018110000000000000">
[edit]  <I>What Fortran compiler do I need to compile Q-E?</I></A>
</H4>

<P>
<B>A:</B> Any non-buggy, or not-too-buggy, fortran-95 compiler should work,
with minimal or no changes to the code. configure may not be able to
recognize your system, though.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION000018120000000000000">
[edit]  <I>Why is configure saying that I have no fortran compiler?</I></A>
</H4>

<P>
<B>A:</B>You haven’t one. Really! More exactly, you have none of the fortran compilers
configure is trying in your execution path. If your hardware/software combination
is supported, fix your execution path.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION000018130000000000000">
[edit]  <I>Why is configure saying that my fortran compiler doesn't work?</I></A>
</H4>

<P>
<B>A:</B> Because it doesn't. Really! More exactly, configure has tried to compile a
small test program and didn't succeed. Your compiler may not be properly 
installed. For Intel compiler on PC's: you may have forgotten to run the
required initialization script for the compiler.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION000018140000000000000">
[edit]  <I>configure says 'unsupported architecture', what should I do?</I></A>
</H4>

<P>
<B>A:</B> If compilation/linking still works, never mind, Otherwise, supply a suitable 
supported architecture to configure: see instructions in README.configure on 
what to do. Note that in most cases you may use configure to produce dependencies, 
then edit the file make.sys.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION000018150000000000000">
[edit]  <I>Why doesn't configure recognize that I have a parallel machine?</I></A>
</H4>

<P>
<B>A:</B>You need a properly configured complete parallel environment. If any piece 
is missing, configure will revert to serial compilation. In particular:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>configure tries to locate a parallel compiler in a logical  place with a logical name,  but if it has a strange names or it is located  in a strange location, you will have to instruct configure to find it. Note that in most PC clusters (Beowulf), there is no parallel Fortran-95 compiler:  you have to configure an appropriate script, such as mpif90.
</LI>
<LI>configure tries to locate libraries (both mathematical and parallel libraries) in logical places with logical names, but if they have strange names or strange locations, you will have to rename/move them, or to instruct configure to find them (see subsection “Libraries”). Note that if MPI libraries are not found, parallel compilation is disabled.
</LI>
<LI>configure tests that the compiler and the libraries are compatible (i.e. the compiler may link the libraries without conflicts and without missing symbols). If they aren't and the compilation fail, configure will revert to serial compilation.
</LI>
</UL>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION000018160000000000000">
[edit]  <I>Compilation fails with "internal error", what should I do?</I></A>
</H4>

<P>
<B>A:</B> Any message saying something like "internal compiler error" means
that your compiler is buggy. If you paid real money for your compiler,
complain with the software vendor. If not: sometimes reducing the optimization
level will do the trick, sometimes rearranging the code solves the problem,
but most often you will need to update your compiler to a less buggy version. 

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION000018170000000000000">
[edit]  <I>Compilation fails at linking stage: "symbol ... not found"</I></A>
</H4>

<P>
<B>A:</B> If the missing symbols (i.e. routines that are called but not found)
are in the code itself: most likely the fortran-to-C conventions used
in file include/c_defs.h are not appropriate. Change them and retry.

<P>
If the missing symbols are in external libraries (Blas, Lapack, FFT, MPI libraries):
there is a name mismatch between what the compiler expects and what the
library provides. This case is described in detail in the User Guide.

<P>
If the missing symbols aren't found anywhere either in the code or in the
libraries: they are system library symbols. i) If they are called by external 
libraries, you need to add a missing system library, or to use a different 
set of external libraries, compiled with the same compiler you are using. 
ii) If you are using no external libraries and still getting missing symbols, 
your compiler and compiler libraries are not correctly installed.

[edit]  <I>Where can I find the crystal structure/atomic positions of XYZ?</I></A>

<P>
<B>A:</B> The following site contains a lot of crystal structures: http://cst-www.nrl.navy.mil/lattice .
"Since this seems to come up often, I'd like to point out that the American Mineralogist Crystal Structure Database (http://rruff.geo.arizona.edu/AMS/amcsd) is another excellent place to find structures, though you will have to use it in conjunction with Bilbao (http://www.cryst.ehu.es), 
and have some understanding of space groups and Wyckoff positions".

<B>A:</B> "You might find this web site useful:
http://www.cryst.ehu.es/cryst/get_kvec.html" (info by Cyrille Barreteau, nov. 2007).

[edit]  <I>Why is the code saying "Wrong atomic coordinates"?</I></A>
</H4>

<P>
<B>A:</B> Because they are: two or more atoms in the list of atoms have
overlapping, or anyway too close, positions. Can't you see why? look better, 
and remember that the code cheks periodic images as well.

[edit]  <I>The code stops with an "error reading namelist xxxx"</I></A>
</H4>

<P>
<B>A:</B> Most likely there is a misspelled variable in namelist xxxx.
If there isn't any (have you looked carefully? really??
REALLY???), beware control 
characters like DOS ^M (control-M): they can confuse
the namelist-reading code. 

<P>
If this message concerns the first namelist to be read
(usually "&amp;control"), and if you are running 
in parallel: try "code -inp input_file" instead of "code &lt; input_file". 
Some MPI libraries do not properly handle input redirection.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION000018250000000000000">
[edit]  <I>How can I choose parameters for variable-cell molecular dynamics?</I></A>
</H4>

<P>
<B>A</B>: “A common mistake many new users make is to set the time step dt
improperly to the same order of magnitude as for CP algorithm, or
not setting dt at all. This will produce a ‘not evolving dynamics’.
Good values for the original RMW (RM Wentzcovitch) dynamics are dt= 50 ÷ 70.
The choice of the cell mass is a delicate matter. An off-optimal mass will
make convergence slower. Too small masses, as well as too long time
steps, can make the algorithm unstable. A good cell mass will make
the oscillation times for internal degrees of freedom comparable to cell
degrees of freedom in non-damped Variable-Cell MD. Test calculations
are advisable before extensive calculation.
I have tested the damping algorithm that I have developed and it has
worked well so far. It allows for a much longer time step (dt=100 ÷ 150)
than the RMW one and is much more stable with very small cell masses,
which is useful when the cell shape, not the internal degrees of freedom,
is far out of equilibrium. It also converges in a smaller number of steps
than RMW.” (Info from Cesar Da Silva: the new damping algorithm is the default
since v. 3.1).

<H4><A NAME="SECTION000018260000000000000">
[edit]  <I>What are the nr1b, nr2b, nr3b?</I></A>
</H4>

<P>
<B>A:</B> <I>ecutrho</I> defines the resolution on the real space FFT mesh (as expressed 
by nr1, nr2 and nr3, that the code left on its own sets automatically).
In the ultrasoft case we refer to this mesh as the ‘hard’ mesh, since it 
is denser than the smooth mesh that is needed to represent the square 
of the non-norm-conserving wavefunctions.

<P>
On this ‘hard’, fine-spaced mesh, you need to determine the size of the
cube that will encompass the largest of the augmentation charges - this
is what nr1b, nr2b, nr3b are.

<P>
So, nr1b is independent of the system size, but dependent on the size
of the augmentation charge (that doesn’t vary that much) and on the
real-space resolution needed by augmentation charges (rule of thumb:
ecutrho is between 6 and 12 times ecutwfc).

<P>
In practice, nr1b et al. are often in the region of 20-24-28; testing seems
again a necessity (unless the code started automagically to estimate these).

<P>
The core charge is in principle finite only at the core region (as defined
by rcut ) and vanishes out side the core. Numerically the charge is
represented in a Fourier series which may give rise to small charge
oscillations outside the core and even to negative charge density, but
only if the cut-oﬀ is too low. Having these small boxes removes the
charge oscillations problem (at least outside the box) and also oﬀers
some numerical advantages in going to higher cut-offs.

<P>
The small boxes should be set as small as possible, but large enough
to contain the core of the largest element in your system.
The formula for determining the box size is quite simple: 

<P>
<PRE>  nr1b = (2 ∗ rcut )/Lx ∗ nr1
</PRE>

<P>
where rcut is the cut-off radius for the largest element and Lx is the
physical length of your box along the x axis. You have to round your
result to the nearest larger integer.” (info by Nicola Marzari)

[edit]  <I>How is the charge density (the potential, etc.) stored? What position in real space corresponds to an array value?</I></A>
</H4>

<P>
<B>A:</B> The index of arrays used to store functions defined on 3D meshes is
actually a shorthand for three indeces, following the FORTRAN convention (“leftmost index runs faster”). An example will explain this better. Suppose you have a 3D array of dimension (nr1,nr2,nr3), say psi(nr1,nr2,nr3). FORTRAN compilers store this array sequentially in the computer RAM in the following way:

<P>
<PRE>       psi(1,1,1)
       psi(2,1,1)
       ...
       psi(nr1,1,1)
       psi(1,2,1)
       psi(2,2,1)
       ...
       psi(nr1,2,1)
       ...
       psi(nr1,nr2,1)
       psi(1,1,nr3)
</PRE>

<P>
etc
Let ind be the position of the (i,j,k) element in the above list: the
relation between ind and (i,j,k) is:

<P>
<PRE>            ind = i + (j − 1) ∗ nr1 + (k − 1) ∗ nr2 ∗ nr1
</PRE>

<P>
This should clarify the relation between 1D and 3D indexing. In real
space, the (i,j,k) point of the mesh is

<P>
<PRE>
</PRE>

<P>
where the τ ’s are the basis vectors of the Bravais lattice. The latter
are stored row-wise in the “AT” array:

.

<P>
The absolute magnetization is the integral of the absolute value of the magnetization 
in the cell:

<P>
In a simple feromagnetic material they should be equal (except possibly for an overall sign)
In simple antiferromagnets (like FeO, NiO) <I>M</I><I>T</I> is zero and <I>M</I><I>A</I> is

[edit]  <I>How can I calculate magnetic moments for each atom?</I></A>
</H4>

<P>
<B>A:</B> There is no 'right' way of defining the local magnetic moment
around an atom in a multi-atom system. However an approximate way to define
it is via the projected density of states on the atomic orbitals (code
projwfc.x, see example08 for its use as a postprocessing tool). This
code generate many files with the density of states projected on each
atomic wavefunction of each atom and a BIG amount of data on the
standard output, the last few lines of which contain the decomposition
of Lowdin charges on angular momentum and spin component of each
atom.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION000018340000000000000">
[edit]  <I>How do I perform a calculation with spin-orbit interactions?</I></A>
</H4>

<P>
<B>A:</B>  The following input variables are relevant for a spin-orbit calculation:

<P>
<PRE>     noncolin=.true./.false.
     lspinorb=.true./.false.
     starting_magnetization (one for each type of atoms)
</PRE>

<P>
To make a spin-orbit calculation noncolin must be true. 
If starting_magnetization is set to zero (or not given)  the code makes a spin orbit calculation without spin magnetization (it assumes that time reversal symmetry holds and it does not calculate the magnetization). The states are still two component spinors but the total magnetization is zero.

<P>
If starting_magnetization is different from zero it makes a non collinear spin polarized calculation with spin orbit. The final spin magnetization might be zero or different from zero depending on the system.

<P>
Furthermore to make a spin-orbit calculation you must use fully relativistic pseudopotentials at least for the atoms in which you think that spin orbit is large. If all the pseudopotentials are scalar relativistic the calculation becomes equivalent to a noncolinear calculation without spin orbit.

[edit]  Is there a simple way to determine the symmetry of a given phonon mode?</A>
</H4>

<P>
<B>A:</B> A symmetry analyzer was added in v.3.2 by Andrea Dal Corso. The following info may still be of interest to somebody, though:

<P>
See the ISOTROPY package: http://stokes.byu.edu/iso/isotropy.html.

“Please follow http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0010-4655(94)00164-W and
http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0010-4655(74)90057-5. These are connected to some 
programs found in the Computer Physics Communications Program Library 
(http://www.cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk ) which are described in the articles:

[edit]  I am not getting zero acoustic mode frequencies, why? </A>
</H4>

<P>
<B>A:</B> "If you treat, e.g., a molecule, the first six frequencies should vanish. 
However, due to convergence (number of plane waves, size of the supercell, 
etc. ) they often appear as imaginary or small real, even if all other 
frequencies are converged with respect to ecut and celldm.

<P>
If you have a bulk structure, then imaginary frequencies indicate a 
lattice instability. However, they can appear also as a result of a 
non-converged groundstate (Ecut, #k, ...).

<P>
Recently I also found that the parameters tr2_ph for the phonons and 
conv_thr for the groundstate can affect the quality of the phonon 
calculation, especially the "vanishing" frequencies for molecules."

[edit]  Why do I get negative phonon frequencies? </A>
</H4>

<P>
<B>A:</B> If these occur for acoustic frequencies at Gamma point, see above.
If these occur for rotational modes in a molecule into a supercell: 
it is a fictitious effect of the finite supercell size. If these
occur in other cases, it depends. It may be a problem of bad
convergence (see above) or it may signal a real instability.

<P>
An example: large negative phonon frequencies in 1-dimensional chains.
"It is because probably some of atoms are sitting on the saddle points 
of the energy surface. Since QE symmetrizes charge density to avoid small 
numerical oscillation, the system cannot break the symmetry with the help 
of numerical noise. Check your system's stability by displacing one or more 
atoms a little bit along the direction of eigen-vector which has negative 
frequency. The eigen-vector can be found in the output of dynamical matrices 
of ph.x. One example here is: for 1d aluminum chain, the LO mode will be 
negative if you place two atoms at (0.0,0.0,0.0) and (0.0,0.0,0.5) of crystal 
coordinates. To break the symmetry enforced by QE code, change the second atom 
coordinate to (0.0,0.0,0.505). Relax the system. You will find the atom will 
get itself a comfortable place at (0.0,0.0,0.727), showing a typical dimerization 
effect." (info by Nicola Marzari).
