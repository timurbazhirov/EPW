 ==============================================================================

Because PWgui is written in [incr Tcl]---an extension of Tcl
scripting language----no compilation is needed.

*** HOWEVER *** the package depends on the [incr Tcl] and related
software. Therefore you have two possibility: 

   (i)  to use a standalone executable which run out of the box (works
	only on the platform for which it has been built)

   (ii) to use source package if required Tcl software is installed
        (see SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS section below)
	
    QUICK-INFO for source package of PWgui: 
    ---------------------------------------
	If you have Tcl/Tk + Itcl/Itk/Iwidgets installed on your
	computer you can use the source version of PWgui
	straightaway. In the other case, one option is to install a
	complete Tcl distribution named ActiveTcl:

(I) INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR STANDALONE EXECUTABLE

The standalone executable run out of the box. It is a self-contained,
and installation-free. Simply download and unzip (or untar). For
zipped pwgui-xxx.zip package do:
	
	* unzip pwgui-xxx.zip, 

while for tarred pwgui-xxx.tgz package do either:

	* tar zxvf pwgui-xxx.tgz 
or: 
	* gunzip -c pwgui-xxx.tgz | tar xvf -

That' all!!! To launch the program type: pwgui.

Here is a list of platforms on which standalone pwgui executables are
available:

+ Linux-i386
+ Macintosh (for Mac OS X, PWgui requires X11)
+ Windows

(II) INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR SOURCE PACKAGE

To use the source package you need required Tcl software (see SOFTWARE
REQUIREMENTS section below). If you are using PWgui's CVS sources see
also the INSTALL.cvs file.

VERY SHORT INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------------------------------

 1. untar the PWgui archive,
 2. define the PWGUI environmental variable (optional for versions >= 4.0)),
 3. add $PWGUI to your path, and
 4. to launch the PWgui program, type: pwgui	


A BIT LONGER INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
---------------------------------------

To install the PWgui package do the following:

   1.) untar the *.tgz archive. use one of the following:

	gunzip -c pwgui.tgz | tar xvf -
     or
	gunzip pwgui.tgz; tar xvf pwgui.tar
     or 
        tar zxvf pwgui.tgz (for GNU tar program only)

   2.) define the PWGUI environmental variable to point to the package
       root directory (optional for versions >= 4.0)

     *  for Bourne compatible shells: PWGUI=/pwgui/root/dir; export PWGUI
     *  for Csh compatible shells:    setenv PWGUI /pwgui/root/dir

   3.) add the PWGUI environmental variable to your path. Depending
       on your shell edit one of ~/.bashrc, ~/.profile, or ~/.cshrc,
       or alike:

     *  for Bourne compatible shells: PATH="$PWGUI:$PATH"
     *  for Csh compatible shells:    set path = ( $PWGUI $path )

   4.) to launch the PWgui program type: pwgui


SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS FOR SOURCE PACKAGE
----------------------------------------

The PWgui source package depends on the following Tcl-related
software:

	Tcl + Tk   >= 8.3
	Itcl + Itk >= 3.1
	Iwidgets   >= 3.0

The Itcl, Itk, and Iwidgets stand for: [incr Tcl], [incr Tk], and
[incr Widgets]. All these packages are usually already present on
modern Linux distributions, otherwise their RPMs (DEBs) can be easily
found on the WEB. 

For Tcl/Tk see:             http://www.tcl.tk/
For ITcl/Itk/Iwidgets see:  http://incrtcl.sourceforge.net/itcl/

Alternatively you may install ActiveTcl which includes all the
Tcl/Tk/Itcl/Itk/Iwidgets. See:  
http://www.activestate.com/Products/activetcl/
