<P>
Working fortran-95 and C compilers are needed in order
to compile Quantum-ESPRESSO. Most so-called “fortran-90” compilers implement the fortran-95 standard, but older versions may not be fortran-95
compliant.

<P>
If you get “Compiler Internal Error” or similar messages: your compiler version is buggy.
Try to lower
the optimization level, or to remove optimization, just for the routine that
has problems. If it doesn’t work, or if you experience weird problems, try to
install patches for your version of the compiler (most vendors release at least
a few patches for free), or to upgrade to a more recent version.

<P>
If you get error messages at the loading phase that looks like 
“file XYZ.o: unknown (unrecognized, invalid, wrong, missing, ... ) file type”, or 
"file format not recognized for fiel XYZ.a”, one of
the following things have happened:

<P>
1. you have leftover object files from a compilation with another compiler: run make clean and recompile.

<P>
2. make does not stop at the first compilation error (it happens with some compilers). Remove file XYZ.o and look for the compilation error.

<P>
If many symbols are missing in the loading phase: you did not specify the
location of all needed libraries (LAPACK, BLAS, FFTW, machine-specific
optimized libraries). If you did, but symbols are still missing, see below (for
Linux PC). Remember: Quantum-Espresso if self-contained (with the exception of
MPI libraries for parallel compilation). If system libraries are missing, the
problem cannot be in Quantum-Espresso.

<P>

[edit] IBM AIX</A>
</H3>

<P>
On IBM machines with ESSL libraries installed, there is a 
potential conﬂict between a few LAPACK routines that are also part of ESSL, 
but with a diﬀerent calling sequence. The appearence of run-time errors like

<P>
<PRE>   ON ENTRY TO ZHPEV       PARAMETER NUMBER       1 HAD AN ILLEGAL VALUE
</PRE>

<P>
is a signal that you are calling the bad routine. If you have defined -D__ESSL
you should load ESSL before LAPACK: see variable LAPACK_LIBS in make.sys.

<P>
On some IBM AIX machines, configure stop with an obscure error saying that
it has no permission to run /usr/bin/oslevel. This is no longer a problem 
for version 3.2 or later. 

<P>

[edit] Linux PC</A>
</H3>

<P>
The web site of Axel Kohlmeyer contains a very informative
section on compiling and running CPMD on Linux. Most of its contents
applies to the Quantum-ESPRESSO code as well:
http://www.theochem.rub.de/ axel.kohlmeyer/cpmd-linux.html. In particular, there is a set of ATLAS libraries, containing all of LAPACK and no external reference to fortran libraries: http://www.theochem.rub.de/ axel.kohlmeyer/cpmd-linux.html#atlas

<P>
It is convenient to create semi-statically linked executables (with only
libc/libm/libpthread linked dynamically). If you want to produce a binary
that runs on diﬀerent machines, compile it on the oldest machine you have
(i.e. the one with the oldest version of the operating system).

<P>
If you get errors like 

<P>
<PRE>  IPO Error: unresolved~: __svml_cos2
</PRE>

<P>
at the linking stage,
this means that your compiler is optimized to use the SSE version of sine, cosine 
etc. contained in the SVML library. Append '-lsvml' to the list of libraries in 
your make.sys file (info by Axel Kohlmeyer, oct.2007).

[edit] Linux PCs with Portland Group compiler (pgf90)</A>
</H4>

<P>
Quantum-ESPRESSO does not work reliably, or not at all, with many versions of the Portland Group compiler (in particular, v.5.2 and 6.0). Version
5.1 used to work, v.6.1 is reported to work (info from Paolo Cazzato). Use
the latest version of each release of the compiler, with patches if available:

<P>
Versions 2.3 ad 2.4 of the Pathscale compiler crash when compiling CPV/phasefactors.f90. Workaround:
replace SUM(na(1:nsp)) with nat (info by Paolo Cazzato; fixed since version
3.1.1).

<P>
Quantum-espresso v.4 supports gfortran v.4.1 and later; note however that only basic
functionalities have been tested. More advanced ones may or may not work. In particular:
reading files produced by previous versions of Q-E may not work, apparently due to a
gfortran bug.

<P>
Quantum-espresso versions &lt; 4 needs some tweaking, such as replacing

[edit] Linux PCs with Intel compiler (ifort, formerly ifc)</A>
</H4>

<P>
If configure doesn’t find the compiler, or if you get “Error loading shared
libraries...” at run time, you may have forgotten to execute the script that
sets up the correct path and library path. Unless your system manager has
done this for you, you should execute the appropriate script — located in
the directory containing the compiler executable — in your initialization files.
Consult the documentation provided by Intel.

<P>
Starting from the latests v 8.1 patchlevels, the recommended way to build
semi-statically linked binaries is to use the -i-static ﬂag; for multi-threaded
libraries the linker ﬂag would be -i-static -openmp (linking libguide is
no longer needed and the compiler will pick the correct one). For previous
versions, try -static-libcxa (this will give an incomplete semi-static link
on newer versions).

<P>
Each major release of the Intel compiler diﬀers a lot from the previous one.
Do not mix compiled objects from diﬀerent releases: they may be incompatible.

<P>
In case of trouble, update your version with the most recent patches,
available via Intel Premier support (registration free of charge for Linux):
http://developer.intel.com/software/products/support/#premier.

<P>
<B>ifort v.10:</B> on 64-bit AMD CPUs, at least some versions of ifort 10.1 
miscompile subroutine write_rho_xml in Module/xml_io_base.f90 with -O2
options. Using -O1 instead solves the problem (info by Carlo Cavazzoni, March 2008).

<P>
<B>ifort v.9:</B> The latest (July 2006) 32-bit version of ifort 9.1 works ﬂawlessy.
Earlier versions yielded “Compiler Internal Error”.

<P>
At least some versions of ifort 9.0 have a buggy preprocessor that either
prevents compilation of iotk, or produces runtime errors in cft3. Update
to a more patched version, or modify make.sys to explicitly perform 
preprocessing using /lib/cpp, as in the following example (courtesy from Sergei
Lisenkov):

<P>
<PRE>  .f90.o:
          \$(CPP) \$(CPPFLAGS) \$&lt; -o \$*.F90
          \$(MPIF90) \$(F90FLAGS) -c \$*.F90 -o \$*.o
</PRE>
<PRE>  CPP       = /lib/cpp
  CPPFLAGS  = -P -C -traditional \$(DFLAGS) \$(IFLAGS)
</PRE>

<P>
On some versions of RedHat Linux, you may get an obscure error: IPO
link: can not find "(" ... , due to a bad system configuration. Add
option -no-ipo to LDFLAGS in file make.sys.

<P>
<B>ifort v.8:</B> Some releases of ifort 8 yield “Compiler Internal Error”. Update
to a more patched version: 8.0.046 for v. 8.0, 8.1.018 for v. 8.1.

<P>
There is a well known problem with ifort 8 and pthreads (that are used
both in Debian Woody and Sarge) that causes “segmentation fault” errors
(info from Lucas Fernandez Seivane). Version 7 did not have this problem.

<P>
<B>ifc v.7:</B> Some releases of ifc 7.0 and 7.1 yield “Compiler Internal Error”
Update to the last version (should be 7.1.41).

<P>
Warnings “size of symbol ... changed ...” are produced by ifc 7.1 a
the loading stage. These seem to be harmless, but they may cause the
loader to stop, depending on your system configuration. If this happen
and no executable is produced, add the following to LDFLAGS: -Xlinker
- 
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>-noinhibit-exec.

<P>
Linux distributions using glibc 2.3 or later (such as e.g. RedHat 9) may be
incompatible with ifc 7.0 and 7.1. The incompatibility shows up in the form
of messages “undefined reference to ‘errno’ ” at linking stage. A workaround
is available: see http://newweb.ices.utexas.edu/misc/ctype.c.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION000011350000000000000">
[edit] Linux PCs with MKL libraries</A>
</H4>

<P>
On Intel CPUs it is very convenient to use Intel MKL libraries. They can be
also used for AMD CPU, selecting the appropriate machine-optimized
libraries, and also together with non-Intel compilers.
MKL contains optimized FFT routines and a FFTW interface, to be separately
compiled, giving a nice speedup with respect to FFTW (but see below!).
If configure doesn’t find MKL, try configure - 
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>-enable-shared. 
Note that ifort 8 fails to load with MKL v. 5.2 or earlier
versions, because some symbols that are referenced by MKL are missing
There is a fix for this (info from Konstantin Kudin): add libF90.a from ifc
7.1 at the linking stage, as the last library. Note that some combinations of
not-so-recent versions of MKL and ifc may yield a lot of “undefined references” 
when statically loaded: use configure - 
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>-enable-shared, or remove
the -static option in make.sys. Note that pwcond.x works only with recent
versions (v.7 or later) of MKL.

<P>
When using/testing/benchmarking MKL on SMP (multiprocessor) machines, 
one should set the environmental variable OMP_NUM_THREADS to 1,
unless the OpenMP parallelization is desired (do not confuse OpenMP and
OpenMPI!!! they refer to diﬀerent parallelization paradigms). MKL by default
sets the variable to the number of CPUs installed and thus gives the impression 
of a much better performance, as the CPU time is only measured
for the master thread (info from Axel Kohlmeyer).

<P>
"One more remark on the subject of intel MKL. I've been doing
some more detailed testing recently and found that Intel is
now turning on multithreading without any warning and that
is for example why their FFT seems faster than FFTW. for serial
and OpenMP based runs this makes no difference (in fact the
multi-threaded FFT helps), but if you run MPI locally, you
actually lose performance. also if you use the 'numactl' tool
on linux to bind a job to a specific cpu core, MKL will still
try to use all available cores (and slow down badly). the
cleanest way of avoiding this mess is to either link with
-lmkl_intel_lp64 -lmkl_sequential -lmkl_core (on 64-bit
i.e. x86_64 and ia64, on ia32 it is -lmkl_intel -lmkl_sequential -lmkl_core) or edit the libmkl_&lt;platform&gt;.a file (I'm using now a file libmkl10.a with:
GROUP (libmkl_intel_lp64.a libmkl_sequential.a libmkl_core.a)
works like a charm" (info from Axel Kohlmeyer, April 2008).

[edit] Fun with precompiled libraries</A>
</H4>

<P>
Since there is no standard fortran 
compiler for Linux, diﬀerent compilers have diﬀerent ideas about the right way to
call external libraries. As a consequence you may have a mismatch between
what your compiler calls (“symbols”) and the actual name of the required
library call. Use the nm command to determine the name of a library call, as
in the following examples:

<P>
<PRE>     nm /usr/local/lib/libblas.a | grep -i 'T daxpy'
</PRE>
<PRE>     nm /usr/local/lib/liblapack.a | grep -i 'T zhegv'
</PRE>

<P>
where typical location and name of libraries is assumed. Most precompiled
libraries have lowercase names with one or two underscores (_) appended.
configure should select the appropriate preprocessing options in make.sys,
but in case of trouble, be aware that:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>the Absoft compiler is case-sensitive (like C and unlike other Fortran compilers) and does not add an underscore to symbol names (note that if your libraries contain uppercase or mixed case names, you are out
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
of luck: You must either recompile your own libraries, or change the #define’s in include/f defs.h);

<P>

<UL>
<LI>both Portland compiler (pgf90) and Intel compiler (ifort/ifc) are case insensitive and add an underscore to symbol names.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Another potential source of trouble is the incompatibility between I/O
libraries used by diﬀerent fortran compilers. This manifests itself under the
form of missing routines with strange names 
(like s_wsfe, do_fio...) at
linking stage. Possible workarounds include

<P>

<UL>
<LI>loading the missing routines; it is often suﬃcient to load -lg2c (sometimes -lm may also be needed); or
</LI>
<LI>(better) to replace the BLAS routine xerbla (it should be the only one containing I/O calls) with a recompiled object. Locate the library containing this routine using nm, for instance:
</LI>
</UL>
<PRE>           nm /path/to/your/libs/libf77blas.a | grep 'T xerbla'
</PRE>

<P>
and replace the object xerbla.o in the library with the one you will compile. In flib/:

<P>
<PRE>           make xerbla.o
           ar rv /path/to/your/libs/libf77blas.a xerbla.o
</PRE>

<P>
If nothing works, you may need to recompile the libraries with your fortran
compiler, or to use the internal (slow) copy.

AMD Athlon CPUs can be basically treated
like Intel Pentium CPUs. You can use the Intel compiler and MKL with
Pentium-3 optimization.

Konstantin Kudin reports that the best results in terms of performances
are obtained with ATLAS optimized BLAS/LAPACK libraries, using AMD
Core Math Library (ACML) for the missing libraries. ACML can be freely
downloaded from AMD web site. Beware: some versions of ACML – i.e.
the GCC version with SSE2 – crash PWscf. The “ nosse2” version appears
to be stable. Load first ATLAS, then ACML, then -lg2c, as in the following example (replace what follows -L with something appropriate to your
configuration):

<P>
<PRE>  -L/location/of/fftw/lib/ -lfftw $\backslash$
  -L/location/of/atlas/lib -lf77blas -llapack -lcblas -latlas $\backslash$
  -L/location/of/gnu32_nosse2/lib -lacml -lg2c
</PRE>

<P>
64-bit CPUs like the AMD Opteron and the Intel Itanium are supported and
should work both in 32-bit emulation and in 64-bit mode. Both the Portland
and the Intel compiler (v8.1 EM64T-edition, available via Intel Premier support) should work. 64-bit executables can address a much larger memory
space, but apparently they are not especially faster than 32-bit executables.
The Intel compiler has been reported to be more reliable and to produce
faster executables wrt the Portland compiler. You may also try g95 or gfortran.

[edit] Linux PC clusters with MPI</A>
</H3>

<P>
PC clusters running some version of MPI
are a very popular computational platform nowadays. Quantum-ESPRESSO
is known to work with at least two of the major MPI implementations
(MPICH, LAM-MPI), plus with the newer MPICH2 and OpenMPI implementation. The
number of possible configurations, in terms of type and version of the MPI libraries, kernels, system libraries, compilers, is very large. Quantum-ESPRESSO
compiles and works on all non-buggy, properly configured hardware and software combinations. You may have to recompile MPI libraries: not all MPI 
installations contain support for the fortran-90 compiler of your choice 
(or for any fortran-90 compiler at all!).
See Axel Kohlmeyer’s web site for precompiled versions of the MPI libraries.
Very useful step-by-step instructions can be found in the following post by 
Javier Antonio Montoya: http://www.democritos.it/pipermail/pw_forum/2008April/008818.htm .

<P>
If Quantum-ESPRESSO does not work for some reason on a PC cluster,
try first if it works in serial execution. A frequent problem with parallel
execution is that Quantum-ESPRESSO does not read from standard input,
due to the configuration of MPI libraries: see section
Running on parallel machines
and Axel Kohlmeyer’s web site for more info.

<P>
If you are dissatisfied with the performances in parallel execution, read
the section on Parallelization issues. See also the following post from
Axel Kohlmeyer:

The stable and unstable versions of g95 are known to work. Recent gfortran versions 
also work, but they may require an updated version of Developer Tools (XCode 2.4.1 
or 2.5), that can be downloaded from Apple. Some tests fails with mysterious errors,
that disappear if fortran BLAS are linked instead of system Atlas libraries. Use:

produce the following linkage error:

<P>
<PRE> ld: Undefined symbols:
 _sprintf\$LDBLStub
 _fprintf\$LDBLStub
 _printf\$LDBLStub
</PRE>

<P>
Workaround: add -lSystemStubs to LDFLAGS in make.sys (information by
Fabrizio Cleri, May 2006).   Other workaround: Set gcc version to 3.3. 
This is done with command

<P>
<PRE> sudo gcc_select 3.3
</PRE>

<P>
If you get the message “Error trying to determine current cc version (got)”
change the order of directory in your PATH variable in order to make /opt/ibm/..
to appear at its end. The xlc alias to cc will stop working, but as soon you
have set gcc version, you can change PATH to its normal directory order
(information by Cesar Da Silva, May 2006).

<P>
On some ppc Mac, g95 does not find mathematical libraries such as sin, cos, tan 
Workaround: add -lSystemStubs to any of the *_LIBS (not to LDFLAGS) in make.sys
(information by Rosa di Felice, July 2007).

Because of an upgrade to a new release of GCC (4.0.1) with MacOSX
10.4.5, the IBM fortran compiler does not work correctly with an error message such as

<P>

  /usr/bin/ld: can’t locate file for: -lgcc

<P>
and fails to run configure properly. The easiest way to correct this bug is to
help the XLF compiler to find the correct location of gcc. Do the following:

<P>
<PRE>     1. sudo mv /etc/opt/ibmcmp/xlf/8.1/xlf.cfg
     /etc/opt/ibmcmp/xlf/8.1/xlf.cfg.2006.MM.DD.HH.MM.SS
     with MM.DD.HH.MM.SS is the current date (MM=month, DD=day
     etc...), then
</PRE>
<PRE>     2. sudo /opt/ibmcmp/xlf/8.1/bin/xlf configure -gcc /usr -install
     -smprt /opt/ibmcmp/xlsmp/1.4 -xlf /opt/ibmcmp/xlf/8.1 -xlfrt
     /opt/ibmcmp/xlf/8.1 -xlflic /opt/ibmcmp/xlf/8.1
     /opt/ibmcmp/xlf/8.1/etc/xlf.base.cfg

replaces the xlf.cfg with the correct location (info by Pascal Thibaudeau,
April 2006).

The Absoft 9.1 compiler on Mac OS-X does not work (info by Axel
Kohlmeyer, June 2006).

<P>
Due to bugs in XLF v.8.1, the libiotk.a library does not work if generated as a static library. Workaround: replace ../iotk/src/libiotk.a
with ../iotk/src/*.o in make.sys. Versions later than 3.1.1 generate a dynamical library. In order to run the executables, the environment variable DYLD LIBRARY PATH must be set to point to the library. With sh/bash,
define:

<P>
<PRE>   export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=\$TOPDIR/iotk/src
</PRE>

<P>
and with csh, tcsh:

<P>
<PRE>   setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH \$TOPDIR/iotk/src

The script moduledep.sh
used by configure doesn’t work properly on old SGI machines: some strings
are truncated (likely a IRIX weirdness). A workaround by Andrea Ferretti:

<P>
Many versions of the MIPS compiler yield compilation errors in conjunction 
with FORALL constructs. There is no known solution other than
editing the FORALL construct that gives a problem, or to replace it with an
equivalent DO...END DO construct.

<P>
Some versions of the MIPS compiler are confused by the presence of
multiple variable renaming in modules, i.e. by constructs like:

<P>
<PRE>   USE mymodule, newname =&gt; oldname
</PRE>

<P>
in the same file. Workaround: don’t use twice the same newname. Fixed in recent versions.
