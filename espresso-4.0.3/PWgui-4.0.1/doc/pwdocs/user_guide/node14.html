[edit] Using PWscf</A>
</H2>

<P>
Input files for the PWscf codes may be either written by hand (the good old
way), or produced via the “PWgui” graphical interface by Anton Kokalj, 
included in the Quantum-ESPRESSO distribution. See PWgui-x.y.z /INSTALL
(where x.y.z is the version number) for more info on PWgui, or GUI/README
if you are using CVS sources.

<P>
You may take the examples distributed with Quantum-ESPRESSO as
templates for writing your own input files: see section 2.3, “Run examples”.
In the following, whenever we mention “Example N”, we refer to those. Input
files are those in the results directories, with names ending in .in (they’ll
appear after you’ve run the examples).

<P>
Note about exchange-correlation: the type of exchange-correlation used
in the calculation is read from PP files. All PP’s must have been generated
using the same exchange-correlation.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION000014100000000000000">
[edit] Electronic and ionic structure calculations</A>
</H3>

<P>
Electronic and ionic structure calculations are performed by program pw.x.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION000014110000000000000">
[edit] Input data</A>
</H4>

<P>
The input data is organized as several namelists, followed by other fields
introduced by keywords.

<P>
The namelists are

<P>
<PRE>     &amp;CONTROL: general variables controlling the run
     &amp;SYSTEM: structural information on the system under investigation
     &amp;ELECTRONS: electronic variables: self-consistency, smearing
     &amp;IONS (optional): ionic variables: relaxation, dynamics
     &amp;CELL (optional): variable-cell dynamics
     &amp;PHONON (optional): information required to produce data for
     phonon calculations
</PRE>

<P>
Optional namelist may be omitted if the calculation to be performed
does not require them. This depends on the value of variable calculation
in namelist &amp;CONTROL. Most variables in namelists have default values. Only
the following variables in &amp;SYSTEM must always be specified:

<P>
<PRE>     ibrav (integer): bravais-lattice index
     celldm (real, dimension 6): crystallographic constants
     nat (integer): number of atoms in the unit cell
     ntyp (integer): number of types of atoms in the unit cell
     ecutwfc (real): kinetic energy cutoff (Ry) for wavefunctions.
</PRE>

<P>
For metallic systems, you have to specify how metallicity is treated by setting
variable occupations. If you choose occupations=’smearing’, you have
to specify the smearing width degauss and optionally the smearing type
smearing. If you choose occupations=’tetrahedra’, you need to specify 
a suitable uniform k-point grid (card K POINTS with option automatic).
Spin-polarized systems must be treated as metallic system, except the 
special case of a single k-point, for which occupation numbers can be fixed
(occupations=’from input’ and card OCCUPATIONS).

<P>
Explanations for the meaning of variables ibrav and celldm are in file
INPUT PW. Please read them carefully. There is a large number of other
variables, having default values, which may or may not fit your needs.

<P>
After the namelists, you have several fields introduced by keywords with
self-explanatory names:

<P>
<PRE>      ATOMIC SPECIES
      ATOMIC POSITIONS
      K POINTS
      CELL PARAMETERS (optional)
      OCCUPATIONS (optional)
      CLIMBING IMAGES (optional)
</PRE>

<P>
The keywords may be followed on the same line by an option. Unknown
fields (including some that are specific to CP code) are ignored by PWscf.
See file Doc/INPUT PW for a detailed explanation of the meaning and format
of the various fields.

<P>
Note about k points: The k-point grid can be either automatically generated 
or manually provided as a list of k-points and a weight in the Irreducible
Brillouin Zone only of the Bravais lattice of the crystal. The code will 
generate (unless instructed not to do so: see variable nosym) all required k-points
and weights if the symmetry of the system is lower than the symmetry of the
Bravais lattice. The automatic generation of k-points follows the convention
of Monkhorst and Pack.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION000014120000000000000">
[edit] Typical cases</A>
</H4>

<P>
We may distinguish the following typical cases for pw.x:

<P>
<B>single-point (fixed-ion) SCF calculation:</B> Set calculation=’scf’.

<P>
Namelists &amp;IONS and &amp;CELL need not to be present (this is the default).
<BR>
See Example 01.

<P>
<B>band structure calculation:</B> First perform a SCF calculation as above;
then do a non-SCF calculation by specifying calculation=’bands’ or
calculation=’nscf’, with the desired k-point grid and number nbnd
of bands. If you are interested in calculating only the Kohn-Sham states
for the given set of k-points, use calculation=’bands’. If you are
interested in further processing of the results of non-SCF calculations
(for instance, in DOS calculations) use calculations=’nscf’.
Specify nosym=.true. to avoid generation of additional k-points in
low symmetry cases. Variables prefix and outdir, which determine
the names of input or output files, should be the same in the two runs.
<BR>
See Example 01. <I>Important:</I> atomic positions are read from input,
NOT from the data file!

<P>
<B>structural optimization:</B> Specify calculation=’relax’ and add namelist &amp;IONS.

<P>
All options for a single SCF calculation apply, plus a few others. You
may follow a structural optimization with a non-SCF band-structure
calculation, but do not forget to update the input ionic coordinates.
<BR>
See Example 03.

<P>
<B>molecular dynamics:</B> Specify calculation=’md’ and time step dt.

<P>
Use variable ion dynamics in namelist &amp;IONS for a fine-grained control
of the kind of dynamics. Other options for setting the initial temperature and for thermalization using velocity rescaling are available. Remember: this is MD on the electronic ground state, not Car-Parrinello MD.
<BR>
See Example 04.

<P>
<B>polarization via Berry Phase:</B> See Example 10, its README, and the documentation in the header of PW/bp_c_phase.f90.

<P>
<B>Nudged Elastic Band calculation:</B>  Specify calculation=’neb’ and add namelist &amp;IONS.

<P>
All options for a single SCF calculation apply, plus a few others. In the
namelist &amp;IONS the number of images used to discretize the elastic band
must be specified. All other variables have a default value. Coordinates
of the initial and final image of the elastic band have to be specified
in the ATOMIC POSITIONS card. A detailed description of all input
variables is contained in the file Doc/INPUT PW. See also Example 17.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION000014130000000000000">
[edit] Data files</A>
</H4>

<P>
The output data files are written in the directory specified by variable
outdir, with names specified by variable prefix (a string that is prepended
to all file names, whose default value is: prefix=’pwscf’). The <I>iotk</I>
toolkit is used to write the file in a XML format, whose definition can
be found in the Developer Manual. In order to use the data directory
on a different machine, you need to convert the binary files to formatted
and back, using the <I>bin/iotk</I> script (v.4 and later).

<P>
The execution stops if you create a file "prefix.EXIT" in the working 
directory. IMPORTANT NOTE: this is the directory where the program 
is executed, NOT the directory "outdir" defined in input, where files 
are written. Note that with some versions of MPI, the "working directory" 
is the directory where the pw.x executable is! The advantage of this 
procedure is that all files are properly closed, whereas  just killing 
the process may leave data and output files in unusable state.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION000014200000000000000">
[edit] Phonon calculations</A>
</H3>

<P>
Phonon calculation is a multiple-step process, with at least two steps:
First, you have to find the ground-state atomic and electronic configuration;
Second, you can calculate phonons using Density-Functional Perturbation Theory.
Further processing to calculate Interatomic Force Constants, to add macroscopic
electric field and impose Acoustic Sum Rules at q=0 may be needed.

<P>
Since version 4 it is possible to safely stop execution of the phonon code using
the same mechanism of the pw.x code, i.e. by creating a file prefix.EXIT in the 
working directory. Execution can be resumed by setting 'recover=.true.' in the
subsequent input data.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION000014210000000000000">
[edit] Single-q calculation</A>
</H4>

<P>
The phonon code ph.x calculates normal modes at a given q-vector, starting
from data files produced by pw.x with a simple SCF calculation. For phonons 
at a generic q-vector, you need to specify the option lnscf=.true. in the
input data of ph.x
( an alternative procedure for phonons at a generic q-vector is to perform
first a SCF calculation, then a band-structure calculation (see above) with 
calculation=’phonon’, specifying the q-vector in variable xq of namelist &amp;PHONON ).

<P>
The output data file appear in the directory specified by variables outdir,
with names specified by variable prefix. After the output file(s) has been
produced (do not remove any of the files, unless you know which are used
and which are not), you can run ph.x.

<P>
The first input line of ph.x is a job identifier. At the second line the
namelist &amp;INPUTPH starts. The meaning of the variables in the namelist
(most of them having a default value) is described in file INPUT PH. Variables
outdir and prefix must be the same as in the input data of pw.x. Presently
you must also specify amass (real, dimension ntyp): the atomic mass of each
atomic type.

<P>
After the namelist you must specify the q-vector of the phonon mode.
This must be the same q-vector given in the input of pw.x.

<P>
Notice that the dynamical matrix calculated by ph.x at q = 0 does not
contain the non-analytic term occuring in polar materials, i.e. there is no
LO-TO splitting in insulators. Moreover no Acoustic Sum Rule (ASR) is
applied. In order to have the complete dynamical matrix at q = 0 including
the non-analytic terms, you need to calculate eﬀective charges by specifying
option epsil=.true. to ph.x.

<P>
Use program dynmat.x to calculate the correct LO-TO splitting, IR cross
sections, and to impose various forms of ASR. If ph.x was instructed to 
calculate Raman coeﬃcients, dynmat.x will also calculate Raman cross sections
for a typical experimental setup.

<P>
A sample phonon calculation is performed in Example 02.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION000014220000000000000">
[edit] Calculation of interatomic force constants in real space</A>
</H4>

<P>
First, dynamical matrices D(q) are calculated and saved for a suitable uniform 
grid of q-vectors (only those in the Irreducible Brillouin Zone of the
crystal are needed). Although this can be done one q-vector at the time, a
simpler procedure is to specify variable ldisp=.true. and to set variables
nq1,nq2,nq3 to some suitable Monkhorst-Pack grid, that will be automatically
generated, centered at q = 0. Do not forget to specify epsil=.true.
in the input data of ph.x if you want the correct TO-LO splitting in polar
materials.

<P>
Second, code q2r.x reads the D(q) dynamical matrices produced in the
preceding step and Fourier-transform them, writing a file of Interatomic Force
Constants in real space, up to a distance that depends on the size of the grid
of q-vectors. Program matdyn.x may be used to produce phonon modes and
frequencies at any q using the Interatomic Force Constants file as input.
See Example 06.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION000014230000000000000">
[edit] Calculation of electron-phonon interaction coefficients</A>
</H4>

<P>
The calculation of electron-phonon coeﬃcients in metals is made diﬃcult by
the slow convergence of the sum at the Fermi energy. It is convenient to 
calculate phonons, for each q-vector of a suitable grid, using a smaller k-point
grid, saving the dynamical matrix and the self-consistent first-order variation
of the potential (variable fildvscf). Then a non-SCF calculation with
a larger k-point grid is performed. Finally the electron-phonon calculation is
performed by specifying elph=.true., trans=.false., and the input files
fildvscf, fildyn. The electron-phonon coeﬃcients are calculated using several
values of gaussian broadening (see PH/elphon.f90) because this quickly
shows whether results are converged or not with respect to the k-point grid
and Gaussian broadening. See Example 07.

<P>
All of the above must be repeated for all desired q-vectors and the final
result is summed over all q-vectors, using pwtools/lambda.x. The input
data for the latter is described in the header of pwtools/lambda.f90.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION000014300000000000000">
[edit] Post-processing</A>
</H3>

<P>
There are a number of auxiliary codes performing postprocessing tasks such
as plotting, averaging, and so on, on the various quantities calculated by
pw.x. Such quantities are saved by pw.x into the output data file(s).

<P>
The main postprocessing code pp.x reads data file(s), extracts or calculates 
the selected quantity, writes it into a format that is suitable for plotting.

<P>
Quantities that can be read or calculated are:

<P>
<PRE>     charge density
     spin polarization
     various potentials
     local density of states at EF
     local density of electronic entropy
     STM images
     wavefunction squared
     electron localization function
     planar averages
     integrated local density of states
</PRE>

<P>
Various types of plotting (along a line, on a plane, three-dimensional, polar)
and output formats (including the popular cube format) can be specified.
The output files can be directly read by the free plotting system Gnuplot
(1D or 2D plots), or by code plotrho.x that comes with PWscf (2D plots),
or by advanced plotting software XCrySDen and gOpenMol (3D plots).

<P>
See file INPUT_PP for a detailed description of the input for code pp.x.
See Example 05 for a charge density plot.

<P>
The postprocessing code bands.x reads data file(s), extracts eigenvalues,
regroups them into bands (the algorithm used to order bands and to resolve
crossings may not work in all circumstances, though). The output is written
to a file in a simple format that can be directly read by plotting program
plotband.x. Unpredictable plots may results if k-points are not in sequence
along lines. See Example 05 for a simple band plot.

<P>
The postprocessing code projwfc.x calculates pro jections of wavefunction
over atomic orbitals. The atomic wavefunctions are those contained
in the pseudopotential file(s). The L¨wdin population analysis (similar to

<P>
Mulliken analysis) is presently implemented. The projected DOS (PDOS,
the DOS pro jected onto atomic orbitals) can also be calculated and written
to file(s). More details on the input data are found in the header of file
PP/projwfc.f90. The auxiliary code sumpdos.x (courtesy of Andrea Ferretti) 
can be used to sum selected PDOS, by specifiying the names of files
containing the desired PDOS. Type sumpdos.x -h or look into the source
code for more details. The total electronic DOS is instead calculated by code
PP/dos.x. See Example 08 for total and pro jected electronic DOS calculations.

<P>
The postprocessing code path int.x is intended to be used in the framework of NEB calculations. 
It is a tool to generate a new path (what is actually generated is the restart file) starting from 
an old one through interpolation (cubic splines). The new path can be discretized with a different 
number of images (this is its main purpose), images are equispaced and the interpolation can be also
performed on a subsection of the old path. The input file needed by path int.x can be easily set up 
with the help of the self-explanatory path_int.sh shell script.
