The grid of k-points in the nscf calculation immediately preceeding
the epw.x run must be uniform, centered at Gamma, and all the points
must belong to the interval [0,1) in reciprocal space (this is a 
requirement of the wannier90 program).

The generation of this mesh can be done using any method. For instance
we can use bin/kpoints.x with a cubic lattice (ibrav = 1), unshifted grid 
[nshift = (/0,0,0/)] and no symmetry reduction (Print all points = y).
Or we can use the following simple tcsh script:

> more kgen.tcsh
cat > script.m << EOF
nk1 = 8;
nk2 = 8;
nk3 = 8;
fid = fopen('klist.dat','w');
for i1=0:nk1-1;
 for i2=0:nk2-1;
  for i3=0:nk3-1;
    kvec = [i1/nk1 i2/nk2 i3/nk3 1/(nk1*nk2*nk3)];
    fprintf(fid,'%12.6f %12.6f %12.6f %12.6f\n',kvec');
  end;
 end;
end;
fclose(fid);
EOF
