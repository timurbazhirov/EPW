The file "qlist.dat" contains the phonon wavevectors (q-points) corresponding
to a uniform grid centered at Gamma. Only the irreducible wedge of the Brilloiun 
zone is needed. These q-points can be generated either by running a standard
self-consistent calculation using pw.x and reading the irreducible k-points
in output, or by running the program kpoints.x.

The specific file format used in this example is only needed in order to run
the whole process automatically using the script "job". Other formats are
perfectly legitimate, provided the script "job" is modified accordingly.
