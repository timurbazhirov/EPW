The file "qlist.dat" contains the phonon wavevectors (q-points) corresponding
to a uniform grid centered at Gamma. Only the irreducible wedge of the Brilloiun 
zone is needed. These q-points can be generated either by running a standard
self-consistent calculation using pw.x and reading the irreducible k-points
in output, or by running the program kpoints.x.

The specific file format used in this example is only needed in order to run
the whole process automatically using the script "job". Other formats are
perfectly legitimate, provided the script "job" is modified accordingly.

In the case of SiC, for some wavevectors q the wavevector -q does not belong 
to the star of q. In this case the phonon code ph.x generates the missing
vectors by using time-reversal symmetry. This feature is buggy in EPW and
has been disabled. In order to generate the missing vectors we need to
manually add the -q in each of these instances. We do this as follows:
> grep "In addition there is the -q list" save/ph.out_q*
This will provide a list of q points. We need to add the corresponding
-q points to the list. In the present example the points in question are 
number 2,3,6,7,8,11, and for these points we add manually the -q at the 
bottom of the list (6 extra points).
