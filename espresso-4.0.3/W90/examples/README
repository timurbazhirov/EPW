To run the examples, follow the instructions in the
Wannier90 Tutorial, which may be found in the 'doc'
directory of the Wannier90 distribution.

In brief:

(1) compile the pw.x pw2wannier90.x and wannier90.x executables
    (the latter is done by typing "make w90" in the root directory
    of the Quantum-Espresso distribution)

(2) run pw.x for the scf calculation: 
    ~> ../../../bin/pw.x < seedname.scf > seedname.scf.out

(3) run pw.x for the nscf calculation:
    ~> ../../../bin/pw.x < seedname.nscf > seedname.nscf.out

(4) run wannier90.x to generate the seedname.nnkp file:
    ~> ../../../bin/wannier90.x -pp seedname

(5) run pw2wannier90.x
    ~> ../../../bin/pw2wannier90.x < seedname.pw2wan > seedname.pw2wan.out

(6) run wannier90.x
    ~ ../../../bin/wannier90.x seedname
