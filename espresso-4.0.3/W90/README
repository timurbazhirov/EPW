tests/      A set of tests to check Wannier90 is installed correctly

To compile, type "make w90" from the root directory of the Quantum-Espresso
distribution.

To check that Wannier90 is working, enter the W90 directory and type 
"make test". This runs a couple of quick tests. You can review the 
results by looking at the file W90/test/wantest.log
