This example shows how to use cp.x to calculate Wannier functions and
to perform dynamics with an external electric field.

The first calculation runs a cp with Wannier functions and generates
from scratch the Wannier orbitals for a water molecule.

The second calculation then applies an electric field in the
z-direction to this water molecule. The molecule should oscillate
about the applied electric field.
