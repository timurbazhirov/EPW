This example shows how to use gipaw.x to calculate the magnetic susceptibility
and NMR chemical shift of fcc Si, diamond, and of two molecules: CH4 and C2H4.

ATTENTION! 
This example is for illustrative purposes. In production calculation one
would need:
1) higher cutoff
2) more k-points for bulks
3) larger supercells for molecules
4) at least two GIPAW projectors per angular momentum channel
