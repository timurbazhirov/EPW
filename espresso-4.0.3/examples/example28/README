This example shows how to run a meta-dynamics simulation using both pw.x and 
cp.x to explore different conformations of the Si6H6 molecule.

The first two simulations are performed at T = 0 K ( a pure conformational
search ) while the third is performed at finite temperature ( T=300 K ).

BEWARE: this example is intended as a test to validate the working condition of
meta-dynamics and NOT to demonstrate the efficiency of this algorithm for a
conformational search.

Given the low accuracy of these calculations (plane waves cut-off and 
thresholds), the small box employed, and the risible number of steps performed,
these results cannot be compared with experiments or with other "ab initio"
calculations.
