This example shows how to use cp.x to perform molecular dynamics
simulation of medium to large systems.

This example consists in calculations with 32, 64, 128, 256 water
molecules and takes a long time to execute. To run a calculation
with up to N molecules, use:
   ./run_example N
Note that "./run_example" alone does nothing.
